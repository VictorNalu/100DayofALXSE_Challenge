Hi there,

Today is Day3 and I worked on my outstanding ALX tasks:

1. Regular Expression
2. Networking Basics #0
3. Networking Basics #1

The concepts of TCP/IP, Mac address, and regular expression are really interesting. Still trying to totally get a grasp of it all.

Heading bk to my tasks now..

P.s: The internet downtime has been really frustrating but we will pull through it.

See you...
