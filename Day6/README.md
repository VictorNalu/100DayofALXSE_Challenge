# Day 6

Today is 18th of May, 2024. Yesterday was Sunday, I didn't code anything. I took it as my off day. I went to church, took photos and edited them. I sent them out today.

Today, the Airbnb-The Console project was released. It seems really interesting. I spoke with my project partner and we already have a heading. We both are doing our individual research to ensure we understand what the project requires. I started rewatching an LLS(Live Learning session) on Python-Almost a circle project as it is similar to this project as it was focused on OOP (Object Oriented Programming): 1. Class 2. Inheritance 3. Python package/import module 4. Json Serialization/Deserialization 5. Getter/Setter methods 6. Unittesting 7. \*args and \*\*kwargs

However, there are also new concepts that are introduced;
a. datetime
b. cmd module
c. uuid module
I also shared the LLS resource with my peers, as it will also help them have a better understanding of what the project requires. I'm currently battling with electricity issues, same as my project partner but that won't deter us. We love to do hard things!

Got to head back to study...

See you....
